abstract = "Abstract Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is a research field concerned with deriving higher-level insights from data. The tasks performed in that field are knowledge intensive and can often benefit from using additional knowledge from various sources. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed in this area that combine Semantic Web data with the data mining and knowledge discovery process. This survey article gives a comprehensive overview of those approaches in different stages of the knowledge discovery process. As an example, we show how Linked Open Data can be used at various stages for building content-based recommender systems. The survey shows that, while there are numerous interesting research works performed, the full potential of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data for data mining and KDD is still to be unlocked. "

abstract = "Abstract Ontology localization is the task of adapting an ontology to a different cultural context, and has been identified as an important task in the context of the Multilingual Semantic Web vision. The key task in ontology localization is translating the lexical layer of an ontology, i.e., its labels, into some foreign language. For this task, we hypothesize that the translation quality can be improved by adapting a machine translation system to the domain of the ontology. To this end, we build on the success of existing statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation techniques on the task. In particular, we investigate three techniques: (i) enriching a phrase table by domain-specific translation candidates acquired from existing Web resources, (ii) relying on Explicit Semantic Analysis as an additional technique for scoring a certain translation of a given source phrase, as well as (iii) adaptation of the language model by means of weighting n-grams with scores obtained from topic modelling. We present in detail the impact of each of these three techniques on the task of translating ontology labels. We show that these techniques have a generally positive effect on the quality of translation of the ontology and that, in combination, they provide a significant improvement in quality. "

abstract = "Abstract In this paper, we present a novel personalized concept-based search mechanism for the Web of Data based on results categorization. The innovation of the paper comes from combining novel categorization and personalization techniques, and using categorization for providing personalization. In our approach, search results (Linked Open Data resources) are dynamically categorized into Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer (UMBEL) concepts using a novel fuzzy retrieval model. Then, results with the same concepts are grouped together to form categories, which we call conceptlenses. Such categorization enables concept-based browsing of the retrieved results aligned to users’ intent or interests. When the user selects a concept lens for exploration, results are immediately personalized. In particular, all concept lenses are personally re-organized according to their similarity to the selected lens. Within the selected concept lens; more relevant results are included using results re-ranking and query expansion, as well as relevant concept lenses are suggested to support results exploration. This allows dynamic adaptation of results to the user’s local choices. We also support interactive personalization; when the user clicks on a result, within the interacted lens, relevant lenses and results are included using results re-ranking and query expansion. Extensive evaluations were performed to assess our approach: (i) Performance of our fuzzy-based categorization approach was evaluated on a particular benchmark (~10,000 mappings). The evaluations showed that we can achieve highly acceptable categorization accuracy and perform better than the vector space model. (ii) Personalized search efficacy was assessed using a user study with 32 participants in a tourist domain. The results revealed that our approach performed significantly better than a non-adaptive baseline search. (iii) Dynamic personalization performance was evaluated, which illustrated that our personalization approach is scalable. (iv) Finally, we compared our system with the existing LOD search engines, which showed that our approach is unique. "

abstract = "Abstract From the Semantic Web’s inception, a number of concurrent initiatives have given rise to multiple segments: large semantic datasets, exposed by query endpoints; online Semantic Web documents, in the form of RDF files; and semantically annotated web content (e.g., using RDFa), semantic sources in their own right. In various mobile application scenarios, online semantic data has proven to be useful. While query endpoints are most commonly exploited, they are mainly useful to expose large semantic datasets. Alternatively, mobile RDF stores are utilized to query local semantic data, but this requires the design-time identification and replication of relevant data. Instead, we present a mobile query service that supports on-the-fly and integrated querying of semantic data, originating from a largely unused portion of the Semantic Web, comprising online RDF files and semantics embedded in annotated webpages. To that end, our solution performs dynamic identification, retrieval and caching of query-relevant semantic data. We explore several data identification and caching alternatives, and investigate the utility of source metadata in optimizing these tasks. Further, we introduce a novel cache replacement strategy, fine-tuned to the described query dataset, and include explicit support for the Open World Assumption. An extensive experimental validation evaluates the query service and its alternative components. "
